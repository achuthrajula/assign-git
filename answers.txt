Q) What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?

Ans) It is a file that specifies names or types of files and folders that needs to be ignored while commiting 
and pushing the local repository into a remote repository. Java projects could have file extensions such as
'.jar', '.war', '.class' etc which are not necessary to be pushed into a remote repository. Such files only live
in local repository and might even have system specific paths which are to others.

Q) What does fast-forward in Git mean?

Ans) When the new branch is a direct decendant from the source branch fast forward can be performed which moves the
HEAD pointer of source branch to the new branch without creating an extra merge commit.

Q) Why should you have different branches?

Ans) Branching helps each individual working on same project but on different functionality clone the original 
code base and isolate their work. It is a good practice to not commit onto the original code base and maintain
multiple branches especially when the product is still in development, only after merging the main and thoroughly 
testing it the main should be fast forwarded to ensure the commit doesnt break any existing functionalities.

Q) In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?

Ans) A project usually has a single Git repository but it depends on the type of project, say a web app could have
more than a repository especially when the app uses different technologies. Example, a react front end and node.js
back end can together contribute the the app but might be better off when pushed into two different repositories.
